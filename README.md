# MiCM Intro to RNA-seq Workshop

This Repo contains the material for an introductory workshop on RNA sequencing.

In this 4-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to the basics of RNA sequencing. The workshop will first cover the biological basis of RNA-seq and the relevant data generating platforms. We will review the basic preprocessing steps to go from raw reads to count data. Key analysis processes including quality control, clustering, differential expression, and gene set enrichment analysis will then be covered. Finally, participants will be introduced to the benefits of single cell technology and how they enable researchers to overcome obstacles found in bulk RNA-seq analyses.
 
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand the data generation steps for RNA-seq data.
- Run basic RNA-seq analyses.
- Understand the outputs of different RNA-seq analysis tools.
  
Pre-requisites:
- Experience with R programming and basic experience with the command line.
- Able to install packages in R and look up documentation.
- Have installed an IDE (preferably RStudio).
- Have installed the specified software and tools (list provided after registration)
